This example illustrates how greedy permutations can be used to compute sketches of persistence diagrams.

Consider a sample persistence diagram, $D$, with $50$ points shown below,

```python {cmd continue="setup" output="html" hide}
with svg_plus_pdf(M, M, 'pointset') as canvas:
    [Point(p.x, M-p.y).draw(canvas) for p in points]
    Line((0,M), (M,0)).draw(canvas)
    Line((0,0), (M,0)).draw(canvas)
    Line((M,0), (M,M)).draw(canvas)
    Line((M,M), (0,M)).draw(canvas)
    Line((0,M), (0,0)).draw(canvas)
```

Computing the greedy permutation on these points gives us a collection of greedy sketches of $D$. The entire diagonal is treated as a single point. Sketch $D_i$ contains the first $i$ points of the greedy permutation of points of $D$.

```python {cmd continue="setup"}
G = list(greedy(D))
```

Sketches $D_i$, where $i \in \{1,2,3,4,5,10\}$, are shown below. $D_1$ always contains a single point, the diagonal. Points that are further away are added gradually and this gives an intuition why a sketch could be considered a good approximation of a persistence diagram at a particular scale.

```python {cmd continue="setup" output="html" hide}
for i in n:
    print("D_"+str(i))
    with svg_plus_pdf(M, M, 'greedysketch_'+str(i)) as canvas:
        for p in G[:i]:
            Point(p[0].x, M - p[0].y, 4).draw(canvas)

        for p in D:
            Point(p.x, M - p.y).draw(canvas)

        Line((0,M), (M,0)).draw(canvas)
        Line((0,0), (M,0)).draw(canvas)
        Line((M,0), (M,M)).draw(canvas)
        Line((M,M), (0,M)).draw(canvas)
        Line((0,M), (0,0)).draw(canvas)
    print('\n')
```
