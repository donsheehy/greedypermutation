Greedy kth Nearest Neighbor Sampling
====================================

The `knnsample` function takes a finite metric space as input and produces a subset with the property that the distance to the second nearest sample is a constant factor approximation to the distance to the kth nearest input point.
Such a sample is called **kth nearest neighbor sample**.
Moreover, the output is given in greedy order.
