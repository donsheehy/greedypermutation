Neighbor Graph
=============

The **Neighbor Graph** is a data structure that maintains a neighborhood graph on a collection of clusters and edges between them.
Each vertex is associated with a cluster of points centered at a single point.
Each cluster has a *cluster radius* equal to the largest distance from the center to a point in the cluster.

The neighbor graph provides for two needs that arise when adding a new point to a greedy permutation (i.e. a new vertex in the neighbor graph).
First, it limits which vertices might be considered to move into the new cluster.
Only the vertices in a neighboring cluster will be checked.
Second, it helps us quickly find the neighbors of the new cluster.
These needs translate into the following two conditions.

1. There is an edge from Cluster A to Cluster B if a point in B could be moved to the cluster of a point in A or vice versa.

2. If we add a point in A as the center of a new cluster.  Its neighbors will be a subset of the neighbors of neighbors of A.

These two conditions respectively suffice to guarantee that when a new cluster is created, we can find the points in the cluster and the neighbors.
In practice, we may keep more neighbors, relying on distances to prune away edges that cannot indicate true neighbors according to the conditions above.
Specifically, we keep edges :math:`A\to B` if the distance from :math:`A` to :math:`B` is at most the radius of :math:`A` plus the radius of :math:`b` plus the maximum of the two radii.
It's not hard to check that if this condition does not hold, then, :math:`A` and :math:`B` cannot be neighbors.

This condition can be relaxed, connecting even more neighbors.
By setting the `nbrconstant`, one :math:`A\to B` if the distance from :math:`A` to :math:`B` is at most the radius of :math:`A` plus the radius of :math:`b` plus `nbrconstant` times the maximum of the two radii.
The default setting is `1`.

It is also possible to modify the neighbor graph to only move points to a new cluster if their current cluster is no longer an approximate nearest neighbor.
This is accomplished by setting the `moveconstant` when constructing the `NeighborGraph`.
Setting this constant to `1/2` checks if the distance to the new cluster center would be at most 1/2 the distance to the current center.
As a result, the points are all associated with clusters centered at 2-approximate nearest neighbors.
The default setting is `1`, resulting in exact nearest neighbors.
It is required that `moveconstant <= nbrconstant`.


Clusters
--------

The interface to a `Cluster` is as follows.

.. autoclass:: greedypermutation.Cluster
  :members:

There are three public attributes:

- `points` an iterable collection of points.
- `center` the center point.
- `radius` the max distance between the center and a point in the cluster.

The NeighborGraph
----------------

A `NeighborGraph` is a `Graph`.

.. autoclass:: greedypermutation.NeighborGraph
