MaxHeap
=======

We provide a simple implementation of a list-based binary max-heap.
In addition to the standard heap operations, the `MaxHeap` provides a `reducekey` method.
Note that this is different from the `reducekey` method that one would normally implement for a min-heap.


.. autofunction:: greedypermutation.MaxHeap.reducekey
