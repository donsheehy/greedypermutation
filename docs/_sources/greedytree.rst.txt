GreedyTree
==========

There are many interesting and complex data structures for doing proximity search such as nearest neighbor search.
This one is designed as a simple hybrid between the sb data structure of Ken Clarkson and Covertrees by Beygelzimer et al.

The main advantage over previous structures is its profound simplicity.
Another side interest is that it doesn't require logarithms because there are no explicit levels in the tree.
